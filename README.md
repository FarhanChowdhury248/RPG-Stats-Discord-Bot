# RPG-Stats-Discord-Bot

This is an RPG stats tracking bot.

# Add the bot

Use the following link to add the bot to your server:
```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=791885012626309130&permissions=519232&scope=bot
```

# Using the code

In order to preserve the original bot, I have hidden the token to run the bot in an environment variable TOKEN.
If you wish to modify this code for your own use,
 please create your own bot on discord and get its token and add a .env file to src and include the token environment variable TOKEN.

# Dependencies

discord.py, python-dotenv
